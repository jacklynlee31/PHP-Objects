<h1>PHP Objects</h1>
Produce a working example of PHP object(s), including a demonstration of polymorphism.

<h3>What is polymorphism?</h3>
* Programming that is object-oriented.
    - Abstract: defines the interface that other subclasses must have
    - Encapsulation: storing data within another object
    - Inheritance: inherit properties from the parent class
* Classes have different functionality but use the same interface.
  * Brings together different classes under one interface.

<h4>objects.php</h4>
* Used examples and definitions from different online sources to build a basic example of polymorphism.
* Created a 'Cat' interface.
* Created an 'eat' method.
* Created a 'Siamese' class and a 'Persian' class.
* Created an 'Owner' class that acts separately from the other classes.
* Used basic 'echo' to show that the code works thoroughly.

<h4>more.php</h4>
* I wanted to create another example of polymorphism.
* Created an 'Adobe' Interface.
* Created 'Illustrator,' 'Photoshop' and 'InDesign' classes.
* Created a 'Designer' class.
